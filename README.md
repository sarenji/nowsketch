# nowsketch

This is a painting and chatting application rolled into one.

Demo: http://paintchat.nodester.com/ (creates a random room)

Enter any room you like by putting the room name after the URL.

Ex: http://paintchat.nodester.com/awesome

## For the future

* Different brushes (size, texture)
* Colors
* User list
* Ability to make rooms private/whitelisted
* Status in chats (so you can kick, mute, etc. Similar to IRC)
* Video playback
* Undo
* Moving canvas around
* Resize canvas per room
* Show (toggleable) circles with nicknames hovering next to it.
* And more!
